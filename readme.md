# Efficient impementation of selected Graph Theory problems
This project contains interesting solutions to various NP-hard problems.
Algorithms are implemented in C language, it's always good to know the basics.
## Finding maximum clique in a multi-digraph
### Exact solution
Usage of greedy coloring and sorting of branches greatly reduces algorithm's time of completion.
## Finding biggest common subgraph
### Exact solution
Modular product of two graphs shows interesting properties and connection between this problem and finding maximum clique.
